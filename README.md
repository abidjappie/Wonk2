# Wonky V2 Web Controller

Browser controller for Wonky V2 Biped (Powered by Cocorokit).

Controller implementation is based on CocoroKit Javascript SDK (https://github.com/YUKAI/cocorokit-js-sdk) which was re-written to support Typescript.

Frontend is written in vanilla JS and module support is provided by SystemJS (https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs)

Typescript source code is still in development!
